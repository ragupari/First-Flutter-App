# My First Flutter App

Welcome to **My First Flutter App**! This is a simple mobile application built with Flutter, following the tutorial available on [Flutter Basics by a REAL Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4nhaszNW4o&t=64s). The app allows you to update text on the screen dynamically using a text input field and buttons.
