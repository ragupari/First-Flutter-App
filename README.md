# **My First Flutter App**

Welcome to **My First Flutter App**! This is a simple yet exciting UI I built using Flutter, following a fantastic tutorial.


## **Tutorial Source**

This app was created based on the insightful tutorial, **[Flutter Basics by a REAL Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4nhaszNW4o&t=64s)**. It walks you through the core concepts of Flutter and helps you build a fully functional app from scratch.


## **App Home Screen**

Here’s a sneak peek at the app’s home screen:
